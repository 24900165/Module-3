# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
x = ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 8, 4, 'n')

print('n' in x)
print(8 in x)
```

## Output
```
True
True
```

## Result

The program successfully checks for the existence of both 'n' and 8 in the tuple and prints the results.
